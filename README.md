This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming related to the management of mutable and immutable references. The code shows how the compiler will prevent potential data races by disallowing the creation of mutable references when immutable references already exist to the same data. The solution illustrates a workaround using the `ref` pattern for scenarios where both types of access are needed.
